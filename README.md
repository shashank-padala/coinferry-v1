# Coinferry

## Product Vision

Coinferry empowers users with an extra layer of security for every crypto transaction. By integrating two-factor authentication (2FA) directly into wallet transactions, Coinferry ensures that even if private keys are compromised, your funds remain secure. Our non-custodial solution currently supports Ethereum and Solana—with plans to expand to additional chains—providing a user-friendly and robust approach to next-gen wallet protection.

## Features

- **2FA for Crypto Transactions:** Secure every transaction with real-time OTP verification.
- **Seamless Wallet Integration:** Easily connect popular crypto wallets like MetaMask and Phantom.
- **Multi-Chain Support:** Built-in support for Ethereum and Solana, with more chains coming soon.
- **Non-Custodial Design:** Maintain full control of your funds while our smart contracts act solely as a verification checkpoint.
